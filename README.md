# Vaults & Vampires

## Overview

Vaults & Vampires is a platform adventure game. The moment-to-moment gameplay is inspired by platform adventure games
such as Conker's Bad Fur Day and Banjo-Kazooie. The game will also feature mechanics and themes inspired by various DnD
modules.

The primary goal for this project is for me to evaluate and become familiar with various Unity assets that I would like
to integrate into my future workflows such as the Odin Inspector & Serializer, Feel, and the GSpawn Level Designer. A
secondary goal is to create and release a playable demo of the game.
