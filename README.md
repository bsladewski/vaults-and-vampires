# Vaults & Vampires

## Overview

Vaults & Vampires is a platform adventure game. The moment-to-moment gameplay is inspired by platform adventure games
such as Conker's Bad Fur Day and Banjo-Kazooie. The game will also feature mechanics and themes inspired by tabletop
role-playing games.

The primary goal for this project is for me to evaluate and become familiar with various Unity assets that I would like
to integrate into my future workflows. This project will also serve as a way for me to test game development workflows
and establish pipelines for asset creation.

## Playable Build
